# Fil Rouge

## Description
Mini project to apply concepts seen in class to an RPG written in C++.

## Project status
- [x] General setup
- [x] V1
- [x] V2
- [x] V3
- [x] V4
- [ ] V5
- [ ] Additional features?

## Dependencies
- **CMake**: for building the project. Minimum version 3.14 required.
- **SFML 2.5.1**: multimedia API, used for graphics

CMakeLists have been configured to directly fetch the git repository of dependencies with FetchContent if the required built library was not found locally so normally dependencies should be integrated into build automatically.

## Possible future plan
- Sprite Movement
- Game Map
- Dialogue Tree/Interaction (Trading/combat system?)
